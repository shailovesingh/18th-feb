    "\n",
    "    1> Efficiency : Api produces efficient, quicker, and more reliable results than the ouput presents by an human being in an organisation.\n",
    "    2> Flexibility : API provides fast and flexible delivery services according to developrs requirements.\n",
    "    3> Integration : The best feature of API is that it allow the movement of the data between various sites and thus enhaces the integrated user    experience.\n",
    "    4> Automation : APIs makes use of robotics computer rather than humans, it produces better and more automated results.\n",

    "Disadvantages of APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1> Cost : Developing and implementing API is costly at times and requires high maintainence.\n",
    "    2> Security issues : using API add another layer of surface which is prone to attacks and hence the security risk problem is common."

    "Web APIs are commonly used for accessing databases and servers, as well as integrating third-party services and data into applications. web APIs provide a standardized way for different software systems to communicate and exchange data over the internet, allowing developers to create applications that can access and use functionality provided by other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common use cases for web APIs include accessing weather data, social media platforms, financial information, and location-based services, among many others. By using web APIs, developers can save time and resources by leveraging existing functionality and data, rather than building everything from scratch.\n",
